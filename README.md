# Aim of this tutorial

In this tutorial we present the main functionalities of the hmer package, using a synthetic example of an epidemiological model. Although self-contained, this tutorial is the natural continuation of [Tutorial 1](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_1/), which gives an overview of the history matching with emulation process and shows how it works through a simple one-dimensional example. Readers that are not familiar with history matching and emulation will find Tutorial 1 particularly helpful.
